# Static-shared-libraries
A library is a collection of precompiled object files which can be linked into programs. The most common use of libraries is to provide system functions, such as the square root function sqrt found in the C math library. External libraries are usually provided in two forms: static libraries and shared libraries. I have created some static and shared libraries.
